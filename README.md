# LRU-FIFO
Problem Statement:- Design, develop and implement a C program to implement page replacement algorithms
LRU and FIFO. Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results.



Description:- LRU (Least Recently Used):The idea behind LRU is that items that haven't been accessed recently are less likely to be used in the near future, so it's better to remove them from the cache to make room for more relevant data.  

FIFO (First-In-First-Out):FIFO evicts the oldest item from the memory when new data needs to be added & memory is full.

FIFO is relatively simple to implement because it doesn't require maintaining access order information like LRU does.
